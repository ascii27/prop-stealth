## What works right now

- Schema is in v1 final shape (10 application tables: users, sessions, agent_clients, invitations + invite tokens, properties + new fields, tenants, tenant_documents, tenant_evaluations, tenant_thread_events, email_outbox).
- API type-checks clean. 6 vitest tests pass (`api/test/invite-token.test.ts`).
- Web build clean (only pre-existing lint issues remain).
- Mailpit running locally on `:1025` SMTP and `:8025` web UI.
- Google OAuth sign-in works for both roles.
- Magic-link invite end-to-end: agent creates invite → API issues token → `/invite/[token]` page validates → "Continue with Google" carries token → callback validates email match, creates owner, links agent_clients, marks invitation accepted.
- Invite errors surface to the user via login page (`?error=invite_invalid|invite_expired|invite_email_mismatch`).
- Properties API is role-aware: owners list/edit their own; agents list across linked owners and create on behalf of a linked owner. Owner-only delete. Owner properties pages read/write through the API with the v1 fields (zip, property_type, monthly_rent_target, notes).

## What's stubbed or placeholder

- `/owner` and `/agent` dashboards — minimal "Coming soon" stubs (Phase J6/J9).
- Owner settings still has only the user info card (Gmail block was removed in A6).
- Marketing homepage copy still describes the old product (Phase K1).

## Sandbox

- URL: `https://wyvern-zebra.exe.xyz`
- API: `:4000`, web: `:8000`, postgres local on the box, Mailpit NOT installed there yet (no email sending in any phase before I anyway).
- The Google OAuth client (`771221835755-654rud12afgptef5s0rdd7gsk65knrnb`) has the sandbox callback `https://wyvern-zebra.exe.xyz/api/auth/google/callback` registered.
- Sandbox redeployed at end of Phase D (HEAD = `22fab0a`).

## Known gaps / follow-ups (not blocking)

Carry these forward as we move through later phases:

1. **`scripts/sandbox-deploy.sh` doesn't `set -e` inside the remote heredoc.** The script silently continued on a failed `git checkout` once already (working tree had a `package-lock.json` change blocking checkout). Worth tightening: add `set -euo pipefail` at the top of the remote script and `git stash || true` before checkout.

2. **Token at-rest hashing (security hardening).** `invite_token` is stored as plaintext in `invitations`. Consider hashing (sha256) before storage and looking up by hash. Defer until Phase I touches the email path.

3. **Migrations not transactional.** `api/src/db/migrate.ts` runs each file via a single `db.query(sql)` with no `BEGIN/COMMIT`. A failed migration mid-file would leave a half-applied schema. Pre-existing infra issue. Worth wrapping each file in a transaction once we add another migration that's risky.

4. **`InviteRow` etc. exported but unused outside `tokens.ts`.** Acceptable as a public API for the module. No action.

5. **`POST /invitations` returns the plaintext token in the response body.** Documented; remove the field from the response once Phase I sends emails so the token only lives in the email.

6. **`tenant_evaluations` lacks a (tenant_id, created_at DESC) compound index.** Low cardinality per tenant, fine for now.

7. **Sandbox does not have Mailpit.** Phase I will need a dev-SMTP server on the sandbox (or we point `SMTP_HOST` at the local Mac via SSH tunnel — TBD).

## Code-review-flagged "Important" items already addressed

- ✅ Email-case-insensitive duplicate guard (Phase B follow-up commit `30032f2`)
- ✅ `properties.occupied` removed from `clients.ts` (Phase A-3 follow-up `b6ef3d1`)
- ✅ `ThreadEvent` shape synced between web and API types (Phase A-4 follow-up `fcfda7d`)

## How to resume

1. Read this file and `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-03-tenant-review-mvp.md` (Phase E onwards).
2. Confirm with `git branch --show-current` you're on `feat/tenant-review-mvp`. If not: `git checkout feat/tenant-review-mvp && git pull`.
3. Verify state: `git log --oneline -3` should show `22fab0a` on top.
4. Verify infra: `docker compose up -d` (postgres + mailpit), `npm install`, `npm run dev`.
5. Pick up Phase E — task E1 is the local storage abstraction (`api/src/storage/local.ts`) with vitest coverage; E2 is tenant CRUD (`api/src/routes/tenants.ts`). Plan text starts at line 2269 of the plan file.
6. Continue subagent-driven cadence: bundle small/coupled tasks, dispatch implementer + spec reviewer + code-quality reviewer per bundle, deploy to sandbox at the end of each phase.

## Memory hooks

- `feedback_sandbox_deploy.md` — user wants the sandbox refreshed at end of each phase.
- `MEMORY.md` index — if a new session, this is auto-loaded.
